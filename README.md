## Splitting C++ template class into .h/.cpp?

The answer is no. To know why, we should look at the compilation process:

* **The header files are never compiled.** They are only preprocessed. 
* The preprocessed code is then clubbed with the cpp file which is actually compiled.
* The compiler has to know the data type of the template class before generating the appropriate memory layout for the object.
* **Template class is not a class but a template for class**, the declaration and the definition of which is generated by the compiler at compile time after knowing the specific type. 
* The first argument of the class method is the "this" operator, and the "this" argument tells about the size of the object.
* In this case if you put the method definitions in a separate cpp file and try to compile it, the object file itself will not be generated with the class information.
